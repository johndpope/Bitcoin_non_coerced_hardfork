# Bitcoin_non_coerced_hardfork

With the, what seems, constant attacks on bitcoin in the past year attempting to co-opt the consensus rules of bitcoin, I've thought many times of whether it is possible to safely hard-fork.  Given the choice between an attacking miner and forking away to a safer set of consensus rules, I don't believe that this would present too much of an issue.  However, the implementation of Segregated Witness (i.e. SegWit), when the consensus changes were overwhelmingly supported, were still contentious, and there was a concerted social media compaign to undermine the bitcoin core open source development group.

There have been many discussions and suggestions that core has agreed that there should need to be some hard-fork required at some point in the future.  Given the adversarial nature of bitcoin and consensus, I can't see how 100% of the current nodes of bitcoin could ever migrate from one set of consensus rules to another.  I'd like to start a dialogue on how this might be achieved, with a suggestion on how it might be implemented without forcing existing bitcoin users to migrate to a different set of consensus rules, but still allow node users to safely do so.
